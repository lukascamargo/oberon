# Ready to Code NodeJS Backend

## Installation

Hey there.

To implement this backend service you should create a file named .env with the following variables:

```env
PORT=
DB_URI=
APP=
```

Where PORT is the port where the backend will run, DB_URI is the mongodb database URI and the APP is the application address.

Then, you should build the application before running it. To build the application you should have installed typescript globally.

```bash
tsc
```

You are ready to go.

```bash
npm run prod
```
